Closed last month.

I have 40 folders labeled sub_01...sub_40. In each folder a text file with data in one column as seen below

File 1

A 1
B 2
C 3

File 2

A 4
B 5
C 6
.
.
.
I want to use the terminal to group these files into one text file. The format I want it to be is as follow:

A B C     
1 2 3
4 5 6
.
.
Can someone please guide me how to do it using terminal in Mac? Thanks

bash

what have you tried so far ? Also, in a single file, can you have several lines with the same label (A, B or C) ? –

Would a solution in Python also be acceptable ? –

btw transposing a file in bash is not trivial at all : stackoverflow.com/questions/1729824/… –

Test files and directories are created with @glennjackman's method.

echo " A B C" > final.txt | for dir in ./sub*; do awk '{$1="";ORS=""}1; END{print "\n"}' $dir/* >> final.txt; done
Output

$ cat final.txt
 A B C
 10 11 12
 20 21 22
 30 31 32
 40 41 42
 50 51 52
A very tricky solution with awk program.
$1="" does basically delete column 1.
ORS="" does delete new line character \n
END{print "\n"} creates new line at the end of transposed line.
Only issue with this piece of code is speed which is uncomparable to @glennjackman's awk due to running awk program over and over again for each file in bash for-loop (I guess).
my one-liner:

real   0m0.154s
user   0m0.006s
sys    0m0.008s
@glennjackman's awk:

real   0m0.004s
user   0m0.000s
sys    0m0.003s
