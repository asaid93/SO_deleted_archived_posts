Closed last month.

I have this JSON file

{
    "name": "John",
    "emp-id": 1,
    "age": 30,
    "balance-amount-1": "-10000.80",
    "balance-amount-2": "0",
    "salary-amount": "20000",
    "Total" : "9999.2"
}
which needs to be processed. Considering : is field seperator I need to

replace every occurences of - with _ in $1
remove double quotes " only around numbers and not string in $2.
Final JSON file

{
    "name": "John",
    "emp_id": 1,
    "age": 30,
    "balance_amount_1": -10000.00,
    "balance_amount_2": 0,
    "salary_amount": 20000,
    "Total": 9999.2
}
I tried few things using sed but could not arrive at a solution working for all the scenarios.

bash
shell
awk
sed
replace

AWK
You have two tasks which I would handle seperately;

First is to change hypens to underscores:

awk -F":" -v OFS=":" '{gsub(/\-/,"_",$1)} {print $0}' file.json > file2.json
output 1 (file2.json)

{
    "name": "John",
    "emp_id": 1,
    "age": 30,
    "balance_amount_1": "-10000.80",
    "balance_amount_2": "0",
    "salary_amount": "20000",
    "Total" : "9999.2"
}
Second is to "remove double quotes around only numbers and not string":

awk -F":" -v OFS=":" '$2~/[[:digit:]]"/{gsub(/\"/,"",$2)} {print $0}' file2.json > file3.json
output 2 (file3.json)

{
    "name": "John",
    "emp-id": 1,
    "age": 30,
    "balance-amount-1": -10000.80,
    "balance-amount-2": 0,
    "salary-amount": 20000,
    "Total" : 9999.2
}
usage of gsub Awk - replace one character only in a certain column
usage of $2~/[[:digit:]]"/ awk partly string match (if column/word partly matches) and Check if a field is an integer in awk
OFS must be defined as well if FS is defined awk unintentionally removing commas
